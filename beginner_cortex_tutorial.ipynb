   "source": "## Final Congratulations! 🎉🎉\n\nYou've now mastered an advanced AI workflow! You can:\n\n1. **Import Python libraries** and set up configurations\n2. **Ask questions in plain English** for both metrics and search\n3. **Use the Search tool** to find relevant conversations and documents\n4. **Use the SQL tool** to query structured business data\n5. **Chain tools together** to create powerful analysis workflows\n6. **Extract and use IDs** to connect different types of data\n7. **Handle complex JSON responses** with nested data structures\n8. **Run generated SQL** to get actionable business insights\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nNow you can answer complex business questions like:\n- \"Which deals mentioned pricing concerns, and what are their values?\"\n- \"Find conversations about competitor mentions, then show me those deal details\"\n- \"Search for frustrated customers, then analyze their purchase history\"\n- \"Find deals mentioning specific features, then calculate their total pipeline value\"\n\n### Practice Ideas\n\nTry these two-step workflows:\n1. Search for conversations mentioning \"timeline\" → Get deal close dates for those deals\n2. Search for \"decision maker\" mentions → Show deal stages and amounts for those opportunities\n3. Search for product name mentions → Calculate revenue by product category\n\n**Remember**: Keep typing everything by hand - this is how you'll truly master these patterns and become comfortable with AI-powered data analysis!"

   "source": "## Step 19: Understanding the Two-Tool Workflow\n\nCongratulations! You just learned how to use **both** Cortex tools together in a powerful workflow:\n\n### What Just Happened?\n\n1. **Search Tool First**: We asked \"Which deals have customers listed ROI or budget concerns?\" \n   - The AI recognized this needed to search through conversation text\n   - It used the **Cortex Search** tool to find relevant conversations\n   - We got back conversation IDs and text snippets\n\n2. **SQL Tool Second**: We asked for deal details using those conversation IDs\n   - The AI recognized this needed structured data from tables\n   - It used the **Cortex Analyst** tool to write SQL\n   - We got back actual deal records with amounts, stages, dates, etc.\n\n### Why This Is Powerful\n\n- **Search** finds the \"what\" and \"where\" - which conversations mentioned specific topics\n- **SQL** finds the \"who\" and \"how much\" - the actual business data behind those conversations\n- Together they let you go from \"I heard someone mention budget issues\" to \"Here are the $2.5M worth of deals that have budget concerns\"\n\n### Key Learning Points\n\n1. **Tool Selection**: The AI automatically chooses which tool to use based on your question\n2. **Chaining Results**: You can use results from one tool to inform questions for another tool\n3. **Business Value**: This workflow helps you connect unstructured conversations to structured business data\n4. **ID Linking**: Conversation IDs are the \"bridge\" that connects search results to database records",
